## I really enjoy that idea about read in e-ink displays, but the content how i like was not avaliable to read on those devices, because that i did that project;
I'm apassinate on novel's, in special wuxias, and one problem on those is because they are not really famous on Brazil as literacture. 
My kindle needs the format mobi to have a nice experience using him, but i don't could find my novel's free in this format. To fix that i maded a script in python 
with him i can download every capitulo after the cap i put on this bot and, in the end, that script create a file with the file format: mobi.
